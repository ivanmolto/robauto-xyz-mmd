# ROBAUTO(XYZ) MONETIZATION MODEL DESIGN

This Monetization Model Design is based on the gameplay output from the Game Design Planning challenge of the game with the title “Robauto.xyz” (referred as Robauto) and it is created as a contribution to the "I, Game & Robot" Monetization Model Design challenge at the DeAutoDAO hackathon at Gitcoin. 

This document focuses on the economic model of the game, mechanism design and trading.
